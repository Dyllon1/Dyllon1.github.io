            <p>
              I am a young father who is determined to prove that no matter what obstacles life throws at you, anything you set your mind to can be accomplished.
            </p>

             Having my daughter at the unripe age of 21 was a huge shock to the system. I`ve always believed you should take accountablity for your actions and this outweighed the idea of an abortion.
             A huge factor in this decision was my amazing girlfriend who seemed to have all her priorities in order. I had no doubts in my mind that we could do this. Fast forward 4 years and my daughter is diagnosed with autism.
             I thought being a parent was a challenge, this opened my eyes to a whole new world of what difficult means. Lack of communication, high energy and super strength are all ingredients for a holy shit sandwich.
<br>
<br>
             Fast forward 2 years. Marley is now 6, much bigger and much stronger but still can not verbally communicate. At times, I feared for the future. Not knowing how she would be, not knowing how I would be.
            The most important thing was to never give up. She has calmed down substantially, her anger is contained and we are on track for her having a bright, maybe normal future. Without my wife, this would not have been possible.
            Without our team this would not be possible.
<br>
<br>
            Because of our situation work has been all over the place. I tried working nights and that lasted about 2 years but it was too much. I would get home at around 6:30AM and try to get some rest before my wife would leave for work at 9:30AM.
            Then the day began of having to watch a high energy non verbal child. needless to say it took its tole on me.
<br>
<br>
            An oppertunity arrised through my best friend who was going to university for business. He just got on with a start up company that was doing manufacturing. They took wine barrels and turned them into furniture. I loved the idea and everyone was around the same age.
            I got hired on as a laborer and as the company grew I got put on as manufacturing manager. This will be an unforgettable experience as I learned a lot about the structure of a business and also a lot about myself.
            During this time however, I was struggling. Life was put on full throttle and I felt like I couldn`t keep up. Some internal hiccups were happening within the company and I was dealing with the passing of my Uncle so i decided this path was not for me.
            I made my decision and gave the company my 1 month notice. It was hard leaving as I had made some amazing friends but I knew I had to do this.
<br>
<br>
            Fast forward 2 months. I am now working in the promotional industry. I`ve always wanted to do sales so I am eagerly excited. I think maybe too excited. I was certain the orders were gonna start flying in, sadly I got a taste of reality. Day after day, week after week,
            nothing. My drive was gone. I felt defeated, I still feel defeated from it. I never took anything personally but I have never felt so second class in my life. I went from being greeted with smiles to get out of my building when I told them why I was there.
<br>
<br>
            Not knowing what options I had now, I decided to really think of what I enjoyed doing. I have always loved tech but never really thought I could go down that path.
            I know a couple people who were involved but tech is there religion. I thought there is no way I could ever get to their level. I decided baby steps. I looked online for a way to learn but any course I started, it was assumed you knew the fundamentals of code,
            which I knew nothing. I stumbled upon a website called Mimo. I couldnt believe I was learning at the pace I was, especially given that my time was limited with my daughter needing my attention. I am now about 6 months in and absolutely love it.
            It has changed the way I think / problem solve. I hope to have a bright future with this but for now it is the greatest hobby I have ever come across.
<br>
<br>
            Until next time....
